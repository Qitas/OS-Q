CAN (Controller Area Network) is a serial bus system, developed to be used in cars to exchange information between different electronic components. Now it is used in nearly all application fields, Industrial, medical, white goods, or pedelecs. CAN was developed by BOSCH. The BOSCH CAN 2.0 B Specification can be downloaded at Bosch or CiA. But now the CAN protocol is standardized by the ISO. The ISO 11898 document is the reference for all CAN implementations.
