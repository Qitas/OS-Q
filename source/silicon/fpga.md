# definition

[FPGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array) (A field-programmable gate array) is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a customer or a designer after manufacturing â€“ hence the term "field-programmable". The FPGA configuration is generally specified using a hardware description language (HDL), similar to that used for an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). Circuit diagrams were previously used to specify the configuration, but this is increasingly rare due to the advent of electronic design automation tools.
