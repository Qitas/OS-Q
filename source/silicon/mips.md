[MIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture) (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages)[1] is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) instruction set architecture (ISA)[2]:A-1[3]:19 developed by MIPS Computer Systems, now MIPS Technologies, based in the United States.

There are multiple versions of MIPS: including MIPS I, II, III, IV, and V; as well as five releases of MIPS32/64 (for 32- and 64-bit implementations, respectively). The early MIPS architectures were 32-bit only; 64-bit versions were developed later. As of April 2017, the current version of MIPS is MIPS32/64 Release 6.[4][5] MIPS32/64 primarily differs from MIPS Iâ€“V by defining the privileged kernel mode System Control Coprocessor in addition to the user mode architecture.
