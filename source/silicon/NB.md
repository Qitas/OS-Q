[NB-IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrowband_IoT) (Narrowband Internet of Things)  is a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) radio technology standard developed by 3GPP to enable a wide range of cellular devices and services.The specification was frozen in 3GPP Release 13 (LTE Advanced Pro), in June 2016.Other 3GPP IoT technologies include eMTC (enhanced Machine-Type Communication) and EC-GSM-IoT.

NB-IoT focuses specifically on indoor coverage, low cost, long battery life, and high connection density. NB-IoT uses a subset of the LTE standard, but limits the bandwidth to a single narrow-band of 200kHz. It uses OFDM modulation for downlink communication and SC-FDMA for uplink communications. 

In March 2019, the Global Mobile Suppliers Association announced that over 100 operators have deployed/launched either NB-IoT or LTE-M networks.[10]. This number had risen to 142 deployed/launched networks by September 2019.
